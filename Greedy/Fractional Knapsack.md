Given weights and values of N items, we need to put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack.
Note: Unlike 0/1 knapsack, you are allowed to break the item. 

 <br>

Example 1:

Input:
N = 3, W = 50
values[] = {60,100,120}
weight[] = {10,20,30}<br>
Output:
240.00<br>
Explanation:Total maximum value of item
we can have is 240.00 from the given
capacity of sack. <br><br>
Example 2:

Input:
N = 2, W = 50
values[] = {60,100}
weight[] = {10,20}<br>
Output:
160.00<br>
Explanation:
Total maximum value of item
we can have is 160.00 from the given
capacity of sack.

Your Task :
Complete the function fractionalKnapsack() that receives maximum capacity , array of structure/class and size n and returns a double value representing the maximum value in knapsack.
Note: The details of structure/class is defined in the comments above the given function.

<br><br>
Expected Time Complexity : O(NlogN)
Expected Auxilliary Space: O(1)
<br>

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= W <= 105
